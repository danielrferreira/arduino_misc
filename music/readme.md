All this projects uses a passive buzzer.

- The prototype1 transform light waves to musical waves.
- The todler music is something I built for my son. Depending on what you press in the pinpad, the buzzer will play a different tune, including Down By The Bay, Wheels on The Bus and Blaze and the Monster Machines
