# Ligth sounds

## Components Needed
- Photo Resistor
- Simple Switch 
- Passive Buzzer
- Arduino Uno (or any other with >4 digital pins and 1 analog pin)
- Encoder

## Comments 
The photo resistor is wired to act as a sensor 5V -> Photo resistor -> Uno Pin -> Resistor -> Ground. 
The sensor sets the frequency for the buzzer. The encoder is used to define delay time. Switch turns on/off.
My dog hated this project, be aware.
